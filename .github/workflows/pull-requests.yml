            Pull request titles must follow [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
            Your PR title needs to be adjusted. You can use [commitlint.io](https://commitlint.io) as a helper.

            Details:

            ```
            ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
            ```

      # Delete a previous comment when the issue has been resolved
